# Introduction

Through this repository, I will demonstrate my understanding of various C programming concepts by incrementally building a program. I will implement the necessary functions by creatimg myfunctions.h header and myfunctions.c implementation files. I will uncomment each section, as I complete it, as well as uploading work incrementally with relevant commit messages, to git. Upon completing this work, I will then continue with Python, following the same process.
