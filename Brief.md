# Assignment Brief: Incremental C Programming Logbook

## Objective:
In this assignment, you will demonstrate your understanding of various C programming concepts by incrementally building a program. You will be provided with a `main.c` file containing commented-out method calls. Your task is to implement the necessary functions by creating a `myfunctions.h` header file and a `myfunctions.c` implementation file. You will uncomment each part section in `main.c` as you complete it, remember to build the `main.exe` to test and submit your work incrementally to Git with suitable commit messages.

## 1. You can download the logbook exercises from here: 

  - [Github classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/114398065-uniofgreenwich-elee1147)
  - [Github classroom Assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/dcEp-FSq)


  - Clone the repository i.e:

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:uniofgreenwich/ELEE1147_Logbooks_YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.git
    ```
  - The contents of the repo will be as follows: 
    - `ELEE1147_Logbook`
      - `.git/`
      - `C/main.c`
      - `Python/main.py`
      - `Brief.md`
      - `README.md`

## 2. Instructions:

### Git Workflow: 
1. **Continual git workflow**
   - For each completed step you must add and commit all changes. 
   - Ensure all commit messgages follow the standard
   - as there are 9 parts to complete, there should be a **minimum** of 9 commits.

2. **Update the README.md**
  - The README.md needs to be updated with the following sections:
      - Introduciton
          - Describe the purpose of the repo, keep it less than 100 words.
          - *hint: Look at the brief*
      - Prequistes 
          - What do you need to run the code in this repo, include version numbers of software/packages
          - *hint: what is available on the university machines that we have/will be using for this module.*
      - Author
          - Add your Github User name as a hyper link to your profile

### C: Implement Part 4: Data Structures

- Uncomment the Part 4 section in `main.c`.
- In `myfunctions.h`, add prototypes for the following functions in the now uncommented section.
- In `myfunctions.c`, implement the above functionality and build data structures called struct


## Python: Implement Part 5: Basic Python Operations
- Uncomment the Part 5 section in `main.py`.
- Create one new file: `myfunctions.py`.
- In `myfunctions.py`, implement the above functions to perform basic math operations.

## Python: Implement Part 6: Basic Python Operations
- Uncomment the Part 6 section in `main.py`.
- In `myfunctions.py`, implement the above functions to perform basic math operations.

## Python: Implement Part 7: Basic Python Operations
- Uncomment the Part 7 section in `main.py`.
- In `myfunctions.py`, implement the above functions to perform basic math operations.

## Python: Implement Part 8: Basic Python Operations
- Uncomment the Part 8 section in `main.py`.
- In `myfunctions.py`, implement the above functions to perform basic math operations.

### Submission:
- Ensure that you have committed each part section incrementally with appropriate commit messages.
- Push your final changes to the remote repository.
- Provide a link to your repository as part of your submission.

### Grading Criteria:
- **Commit Quality (20%):** Each commit message should clearly describe the changes made.
- **Incremental Submission (20%):** Each part section should be committed and pushed incrementally.
- **Correctness C (20%):** The functions should work correctly as per the requirements of each part.
- **Correctness Python (20%):** The functions should work correctly as per the requirements of each part.
- **Code Quality (20%):** Code should be well-organized and commented where necessary.
